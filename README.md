# MapReduce-to-detect-Election-Fraud
This rep contains code for implementation of map-reduce to detect election fraud using python
In this task we investigate whether there was election fraud in 2008. we have 2006 and 2008
election data files taken from http://digital.cs.usu.edu/~kyumin/cs5665/homework/data2006.txt
The format of the text file is:
VoterID \t CountyID \t PartyID
A) Which party won the election in 2008?
B) In 2006, which county was the most monolithic in the manner in which they voted? (i.e. which county came
closest to voting 100% for a single party).
C) Studies have shown if a political party gains more than 50% in voting percentage from one election cycle to
the next, then most likely fraud has occurred. (Example, if party A received 100 votes in 2006 in county B, then
received 200 votes in 2008, fraud may have occurred). In which counties in 2008 did voter fraud likely occur?
D) From 2006 to 2008 how many voters changed which party they voted for? What is the most common type of
change?
